                    Being able to quickly analyze data can help your users make better business decisions.
                    Our react grid makes it easy to summarize, analyze, explore, and present any data in just a few
                    clicks.
                    That's achieved through the use of the grouping/aggregation and pivoting functionality.
                    We've got everything you'd expect from a table grid: grouping by specific columns, applying various
                    aggregate functions, having row and column totals and others.

                    GUI is still the preferred way for interaction with widgets for your users. That's why we've put a
                    lot
                    of
                    emphasis on the UI controls to make the best react grid in the world.
                    Our grid implements customizable column and context menus which is a must-have for modern react data
                    grids. They provide a convenient way to filter and copy/paste records, resize and pin columns and
                    perform other UI actions. The react grid example above gives a short demo of that functionality.

                    Often business data has hierarchical relationships between entities.
                    To make it easy to work this kind of information, our react data
                    grid implements the tree view specifically designed to display
                    parent / child relationships between entities. The tree view implements a convenient mechanism to
                    expand
                    and
                    collapse groups in one click. And when you need to perform some analysis, the grid has
                    data aggregation and filtering functionality available for you even in the tree view.
